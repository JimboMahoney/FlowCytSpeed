# FlowCytSpeed
R Script to plot the average event rate in flow or mass cytometry (FCS) files.

As per the description, I created this script as a "QC" step to examine the rate of flow of cells (flow/mass) and/or events and cells (mass) on a flow or mass cytometer.

I got the idea from another package, [FlowAI](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowAI.html). That package could (and should?) be used to cleanup any data that has big spikes in the flow rate.

Example output:
